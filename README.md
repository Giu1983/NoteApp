@Biliana: 
I just wrote the React basic code and now I will work on the code to make data driven the components for the user interaction custom data. 

I think to do it I have just to add a method that allows the user to add note in the text editor, edit and delete them. 

So, from the parent component (class) I will use the paraemtters "props" to "spread" the propriety of the parent to the children,  set the status, and add the method. 
Right?
